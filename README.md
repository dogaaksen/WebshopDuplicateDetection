This repository is an assignment for the course Computer Science For Business Analytics (FEM21037) from the Erasmus University of Rotterdam.

This assignment implements a scalable solution for detecting duplicate products in large datasets. 
The solution utilizes advanced techniques such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and hierarchical clustering to efficiently process and identify duplicate products among numerous web shops.

lsh_cluster.py: This is the script containing all functions and algorithms for data processing, minHashing, LSH, Jaccard similarity, clustering, and analysis.
main_cluster.py: This is the primary script where we import the data and start the algorithm by calling the functions from lsh_cluster.py and constructing the plots from the bootstraps.

Programming Buddy: Manuel Dessing
